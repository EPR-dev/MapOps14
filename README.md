# MapOps — Generic GitHub Pages Package
Upload these files to a fresh repo and enable GitHub Pages.

## Files
- `index.html` — homepage (from your uploaded build)
- `why.html` — expanded Why MapOps page with inline demo form
- `.nojekyll` — disables Jekyll processing (serves static files verbatim)
- `404.html` — redirects any bad URL to the homepage
- `README.md` — quick steps

## Publish
1) Create a new repo (any name).  
2) Upload all files at the repo root.  
3) Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch (main), folder `/ (root)`.  
4) Visit the URL GitHub shows on the Pages screen.

Links are relative, so everything works at any repo path.
